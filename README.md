# Prodomy

Prodomy is a Smart Real Estate Listings Platform MVP for Polish apartments. It ingests listings from one public marketplace, normalizes noisy source data, keeps low-quality and duplicate outcomes observable internally, and exposes only published primary listings through a Next.js application and public API.

## Project overview

The MVP focuses on:

- apartments only
- sale and long-term rent
- PLN only
- one marketplace integration
- four target cities: Kraków, Warszawa, Wrocław, Gdańsk
- deterministic seed data when live crawling is unavailable
- public browse, search, filtering, pagination, and listing details

Excluded on purpose:

- authentication
- saved searches
- favourites
- maps and coordinates
- multiple marketplaces
- Elasticsearch or vector search
- admin dashboards
- production anti-bot workarounds

## Architecture

Application flow:

```text
Marketplace
  -> Crawlee crawler
  -> selected marketplace adapter
  -> normalization
  -> quality gate
  -> deduplication
  -> MySQL / Prisma
  -> repository
  -> service
  -> Next.js pages and Route Handlers
```

Backend dependency direction:

```text
UI / Route Handlers
  -> Services
  -> Repositories
  -> Prisma
  -> MySQL
```

Important boundaries:

- Route Handlers do not query Prisma directly.
- Public pages call services directly from Server Components instead of fetching the app's own API.
- Marketplace selectors stay inside `src/scraping/selected-marketplace`.
- Normalizers do not depend on DOM or Cheerio.
- Public DTOs do not expose raw payloads, raw source attributes, ingestion warnings, or duplicate internals.

## Technology choices

- Next.js App Router for the application shell and server rendering
- React 19 for UI
- TypeScript strict mode for safety
- Prisma + MySQL for persistence
- Zod for environment variables, HTTP input, and key data boundaries
- Crawlee + CheerioCrawler for ingestion
- Vitest for unit and integration tests
- Docker Compose for local MySQL
- pnpm as the package manager

## Selected marketplace

- Source: `Morizon.pl`
- Why selected: public apartment sale and rent listings exist across the target cities with enough volume for MVP sampling.
- Useful data location: result pages, listing HTML, and embedded server-rendered Nuxt payload data.
- Crawler requirement: `CheerioCrawler` is sufficient for the implemented integration.

## Scraping limitations

- No CAPTCHA bypass, no login bypass, and no proxy rotation are implemented.
- Marketplace HTML and embedded data can change without notice.
- Phone numbers may be masked in visible HTML; the parser uses public embedded Nuxt data when available.
- Live crawling has been smoke-tested, but fixture-backed parsing is the more reproducible test path in this environment.

## AI status

AI is not implemented in the MVP. This is deliberate: the core acceptance criteria around crawling, normalization, quality gates, deduplication, search, and details pages take priority. Vague-intent discovery is documented below as a future product journey, not as shipped AI behavior.

## Local setup

1. Copy the environment template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start MySQL:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

4. Generate Prisma client:

```bash
pnpm db:generate
```

5. Apply migrations:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

6. Seed deterministic sample data:

```bash
pnpm db:seed
```

7. Start the app:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

8. Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000/listings
```

## Docker and MySQL startup

The local database service is defined in `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

Connection defaults:

- host: `127.0.0.1`
- port: `3306`
- database: `prodomy`
- user: `prodomy`

## Migrations

Generate Prisma client:

```bash
pnpm db:generate
```

Apply local development migration:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

The legacy aliases below are also available:

```bash
pnpm prisma:generate
pnpm prisma:migrate
```

## Seed command

The seed is deterministic and reproducible:

```bash
pnpm db:seed
```

Legacy alias:

```bash
pnpm prisma:seed
```

The seeded dataset includes approximately 100 published primary listings plus a small number of rejected, needs-review, and duplicate records so public visibility rules can be verified.

## Ingestion command

Run the live ingestion CLI:

```bash
pnpm ingest
```

It runs outside HTTP requests and persists accepted, rejected, review, duplicate, and issue outcomes.

## Tests and validation

Run the main checks:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Note: `tsconfig.json` includes `.next/types/**/*.ts`, so on a clean workspace `pnpm typecheck` may require `pnpm build` first to regenerate Next.js type artifacts.

## Public application behavior

`/listings` supports:

- sale/rent filter
- text search
- city filter
- district filter
- minimum and maximum price
- minimum and maximum area
- room filter
- sort selector
- active-offers control
- reset action
- result count
- page-based pagination

All search state is stored in URL query parameters, so reloads and shared URLs restore the same search.

`/listings/[id]` shows:

- image gallery
- title and transaction badge
- price
- administrative fee for rent when known
- deposit when known
- area and rooms
- location
- floor and building data
- normalized features
- seller/contact information when available
- cleaned description
- source freshness
- original listing link
- external-source notice

## Sample user journeys

### Structured Kraków apartment search

1. Open `/listings`.
2. Select `Sprzedaż`.
3. Choose `Kraków`.
4. Set `Cena od` and `Cena do`.
5. Set `Metraż od` and `Metraż do`.
6. Optionally set `Pokoje`.
7. Sort by `Cena rosnąco` or `Najnowsze`.
8. Open a matching detail page.

### Vague intent example

Example user intent: “Szukam przytulnego mieszkania w Krakowie z balkonem, najlepiej w spokojnej okolicy.”

Current MVP behavior:

- the user can use text search plus structured filters manually
- the app does not yet translate vague intent into filters automatically
- AI assistance is explicitly unimplemented in this stage

## Known limitations

- Public text search is simple Prisma-based `contains` matching, not ranked search.
- The local dev experience can be affected if `pnpm` decides `node_modules` must be recreated while network access is unavailable.
- Live crawling depends on one marketplace’s markup and embedded data stability.
- The frontend is intentionally restrained and does not include accounts, saved state, or advanced personalization.
